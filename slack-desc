libsamplerate: libsamplerate (a Sample Rate Converter for audio)
libsamplerate:
libsamplerate: Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate
libsamplerate: Converter for audio. One example of where such a thing would
libsamplerate: be useful is converting audio from the CD sample rate of
libsamplerate: 44.1kHz to the 48kHz sample rate used by DAT players.
libsamplerate: SRC is capable of arbitrary and time varying conversions;
libsamplerate: from downsampling by a factor of 256 to upsampling by the
libsamplerate: same factor. The conversion ratio can also vary with time for
libsamplerate: speeding up and slowing down effects.
